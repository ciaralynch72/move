# User Experience (UX)

## Site Aims

* To provide the user with a website that allows them to view book listings and reviews geared toward children
* To easily find books that may spark a love of books for their child.
* To allow the user to create, update and delete reviews
* To provide the admin user with the ability to approve, update and delete book reviews in the frontend
* To provide a clear and appropriate response to any user inputs or actions


## Agile Methodology

The Agile Methodology was used to plan this project. This was implemented through Github and the Project Board, which can be seen here -  <a href="https://github.com/users/LauraMayock/projects/3" target="_blank"> The happy reader Project </a>

Through the use of the Kanban board in the projects view in Github, the project was divided into a few different sections:
* No status
* Backlog
* Current Iteration
* In Progress
* Done

Layout.

Github issues were used to create User Stories and any other Fixes or Updates for the project. This is where the project user was assigned; labels were added to show at a glance importance of tasks and help prioritize jobs. User story was added to the appropriate Iteration and the project. Each User Story, Fix or Update had a clear title, acceptance criteria and smaller tasks (if applicable).

Milestones were used to create Iterations. There were 3 Iterations, each dated appropriately. User Stories were completed based on the current Iteration that was in progress.
