# **Move Mo Chara Blog**

![Move Mo Chara Blog](/)

Move Mo Chara Blog was created to help be a hub for my friend Carly's passion project, Move Mo Chara Podcast. Move Mo Chara came about because Carly is passionate about movement in all forms and she has a natuaral ability to be able to hold the audience captive thoughout the interview. The podcast is more focused on the movement of body, however, Carly has a natural curiostiy about movement in all shapes and forms from moving abroad, careers and travel and most of all, challenging herself to move out of her comfort zone. I wanted to help my friend create a hub where she can experss herself to expand beyond the podcast and blog her adventures to her audience.

## Design <a name="design"></a>

The design was centered around the Move Mo Chara Podcast design that Carly had created when she began the podcast. 

The graphic paired with the green is a perfect mix that will hold the test of time and not outdate. 

### Colours <a name="colours"></a>

A light green color was used as the main desing color and accented with with an off white and grey. When you look into the psychology of green it is the perfect primary color for the this blog.

Green is regarded as the most restful and relaxing colour to the human eye. It is a colour that can help you restore your depleted energy. If you are feeling too much stress due to modern living, the colour of green can serve as your sanctuary. This dominant colour of nature helps restore our sense of well-being.

Green is a generous, relaxing colour that revitalizes our body and mind. 



### Typography <a name="typography"></a>

### Imagery <a name="imagery"></a>

Images were obtained from Carly's gallery with her permission to use them.

The great thing about using personal photos is that it relatable to the audience creating a connection with the user and a natural flow to the website.

## Agile Methodology

The Agile Methodology was used to plan this project. This was implemented through Github and the Project Board, which can be seen here -  <a href="" target="_blank">  </a>

Through the use of the Kanban board in the projects view in Github, the project was divided into a few different sections:

![Kanban board github]

Github issues were used to create User Stories and any other Fixes or Updates for the project. This is where the project user was assigned; labels were added to show at a glance importance of tasks and help prioritize jobs. User story was added to the appropriate Iteration and the project. Each User Story, Fix or Update had a clear title, acceptance criteria and smaller tasks (if applicable).

Milestones were used to create Iterations. There were 3 Iterations, each dated appropriately. User Stories were completed based on the current Iteration that was in progress.
